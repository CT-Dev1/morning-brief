    "- Start with a short greeting and transition into the day's content.\n",
    "- Weave together the information from calendar events, emails, stock prices, tasks, weather, and news headlines in a way that flows naturally.\n",
    "- Emphasize what's most important first (e.g., urgent emails, upcoming high-priority calendar events).\n",
    "- Highlight the weather and news at the end as a \"look ahead\" for the day.\n",
