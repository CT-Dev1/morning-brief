# PLANNING

# 1) create script that periodically stores the weather data from a set list of cities every day 

# 2) generate an API call that retrieves the future weather for the day

# 3) set up the script to periodically report the weather at set points during the day

# IT should also report increase in temperature from the previous day, and relative temperature to the rest of europe
